# Contract Bridger

## Description

Welcome to the future of blockchain development, where the arduous task of deploying contracts across different chains becomes a breeze. Say goodbye to the days of laborious searching, coding, compiling, and deployingâ€”introducing Contract Bridger, a revolutionary tool that simplifies and accelerates the process like never before.

This project consists of two services: `contract-bridgers` and `interface`, running in Docker. The `contract-bridgers` service is a server running on port 8080, and the `interface` service is a client running on port 3000.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karan-Shah-2513/bct-contract-bridger.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bct-contract-bridger
   ```

3. Build and start the Docker services:
